# Facial-Expression-Recognition
This repository contains the source code and resources for a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) project. The project aims to recognize and classify facial expressions from images or live video streams using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is the process of identifying emotions or expressions displayed on a person's face, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify facial expressions from images or real-time video data.

## Features
- Preprocessing and feature extraction from facial images
- Training of deep learning models for facial expression recognition
- Real-time emotion detection from video streams
- Web interface for uploading images and detecting expressions
- Evaluation of model performance using various metrics

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-expression-recognition.git](https://github.com/saurabh-028/Facial-Expression-Recognition`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the necessary pretrained models or datasets.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the following dataset for training and evaluation:

- [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)

Please refer to the dataset website for more information on how to obtain the dataset.
